This mod allows you to take Monika back into her world after she deleted everything at the end of **Doki Doki Literature Club**. However, Monika doesn't feel at ease about being back in her world again. She always said that she heard whispers even though she was safe and alone in the **Spaceroom**. What have you done... Everything is wrong... This submod has been hijacked by... **Qebv tbob ebob qeb telib qfjb... Qebv tbob txqzefkd xka klt qebv cfkxiiv exsb x zexkzb... yrq x zexkzb clo texq? Obsbkdb? Ilsb?
